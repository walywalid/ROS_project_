# ViBoT M2 Robotics Engineering Project : Autorace with Turtlebot3 

This repository hosts the work done for the 2021/2022 M2 academic year. In addition the bash files, configured packages, photos, & videos.

### **Project Description**

 ### *The track :*
 
 The autorace track is a well known ROS turtlebot3 where computer vision and robotics engineers take on the challenge to set a record time, using either some or all sensors, and as well use computer vision applications to have better tracking and avoidance of objects and landmarks.
